# Orbital Debris Detection and Collision Avoidance System

A simple web application to simulate satellite and debris tracking in space. Uses AI to predict collisions and suggest possible avoidance maneuvers.

## Features

- Predicts potential collisions between satellites and debris
- Shows real-time 3D visualization using CesiumJS
- Simple AI prediction using linear regression
- Built with Flask (Python backend) and HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend

## Tech Stack

- Python (Flask)
- JavaScript (CesiumJS)
- Skyfield (for satellite position)
- scikit-learn (for AI prediction)
